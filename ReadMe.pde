//Brief description of the animation achieved : The animation achieved is a small game. Apon starting the game
//the user will be given the option to enter their name and how difficult they want the game to be. They will then 
//be able to play the game where they will either win by dodging all the obsticles or lose by getting hit

//                    : Setters in Obsticle class refuse to work properly
//                    : Score sometimes fails to record properly
